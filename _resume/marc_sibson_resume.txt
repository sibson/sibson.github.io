Profile
----------------
I'm a problem solving leader who loves challenges and growth.
As a developer turned manager, my goal continues to be building high impact and delightful products, but now I'm focused on helping others thrive and excel while doing so.
Building vision, culture and teams rather than code has taught me to appreciate the complexity, nuance and unpredictability people introduce into the system.
I'm looking forward to broadening my horizons, learning from my peers and making a difference.
