Profile
----------------
I'm a problem solving leader who loves challenges and growth.
As a developer turned manager, my goal continues to be building high impact and delightful products, but now I'm focused on helping others thrive and excel while doing so.
Building vision, culture and teams rather than code has taught me to appreciate the complexity, nuance and obstacles people introduce.
Having recently moved to Ontario after nearly ten years on the west coast, I'm longing for a return to moderate winters, ocean beaches and proper mountains on my doorstep.
I'm looking forward to broadening my horizons, learning from my peers and making a difference.
