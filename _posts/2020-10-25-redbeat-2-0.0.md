[RedBeat](https://github.com/sibson/redbeat) is a [Celery Beat Scheduler](http://celery.readthedocs.org/en/latest/userguide/periodic-tasks.html) that stores the scheduled tasks and runtime metadata in [Redis](http://redis.io/).

It took three years to get to 1.0 and now in less than six months we have 2.0.
The major version jump is due to breaking changes, that people should test for compatibliity before upgrading.
The major new features come from the commumity and include timezone support and improved configuration handling
