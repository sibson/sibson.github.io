[RedBeat](https://github.com/sibson/redbeat) is a [Celery Beat Scheduler](http://celery.readthedocs.org/en/latest/userguide/periodic-tasks.html) that stores the scheduled tasks and runtime metadata in [Redis](http://redis.io/).


This is the 1.0 release, which is less about features and more an acknowledgement that RedBeat is reasonably complete.


  - add warning for non-UTC timezones
