[vncdotool][1] is a command line VNC client. A handy way to automate interactions with virtual machines or hardware devices. This release contains various bugfixes and 4 new commands.

1) pause, wait before sending the next command, sometimes you just can&#8217;t avoid sleeping  
2) mouseup and mousedown, allow you to press and hold the mouse button  
3) drag, move the mouse to a new coordinate by steps rather than jumping to the final destination

More information can be found at [pypi][1]. Bugs can be filed at [Github][2].
