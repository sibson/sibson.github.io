vncdotool is a command line VNC client and library, this release improves server compatibility and makes the library API more useful.  There is now a mailing list at [vncdotool@googlegroups.com](mailto:vncdotool@googlegroups.com) can be used for vncdotool related discussion.  vncdotool 0.9.0 is available on [PyPi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/vncdotool/0.9.0) and [GitHub](https://github.com/sibson/vncdotool/releases/tag/v0.9.0)

On the compatabilty front *&#8211;force-caps* now handles more special characters ```\`[~!@#$%^&*()_+{}|:"<>?]'``` and ```--force-caps=True``` may become the default in the next release. The default pause between commands has been increased from 0 to 10ms, as some servers were dropping keypresses when sending type commands. With these changes vncdotool should \*just work\* with most servers.

Using vncdotool within a python script has been a popular request. Thanks to feedback on the 0.8 api module this release includes a number of important improvements. The API now works with passworded servers, plays nicer with PIL and supports connections to multiple servers.

For a full list of changes see the [HISTORY](https://github.com/sibson/vncdotool/blob/master/HISTORY.txt)

As always thanks to everyone who provided feedback, bug reports and pull requests.  In particular, yhanks to Jan Sedlák, Daniel Stelter-Gliese, Antti Kervinen, Anatoly Techtonik, Tyler Oderkirk and Aragats Amirkhanyan.
