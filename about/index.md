A problem solving leader who loves challenges and growth. 
After ten years as a Software Developer, I've become more focused on helping others thrive and excel.
As a leader I've discovered an appreciation for the complexity of people and
the numerous obstacles that we need to overcome to create outstanding products,
value and teams.
As a developer, I successfully juggled evolving requirements and blended new technologies into robust and elegant products. 
I ran the gamut from full-stack web development, 
creating and operating distributed highly available systems, 
crafting custom lightweight Linux distributions,
down to kernel drivers and embedded device development.
